- - 29 where the NIF term does not seem to match an OB Foundry term —> These all Match (see Notes column) 
- - 118 where the NIF term matches a term in PR and therefore the test script/web services did not result in a correct designation 
- 149 of review manually since the shared synonym is between 2 NIF terms or between 2 NIF terms and some other term (** Review Manually **) 
- - 63 of these match, just had multiple IDs so did not check automatically
- - the rest are overlaps between terms with prefix nifext and based on those examined appear to be duplicates in NIF-Molecule
